javaparser = """System Description: Here's a structured summary of the JavaParser system based on the provided knowledge graph:

1. System Purpose:
JavaParser is a Java source code analysis and manipulation tool that provides capabilities to parse, analyze, and transform Java source code through an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation.

2. Key Components & Responsibilities:

Node Class:

Base class for all AST elements
Handles parent-child relationships
Manages node traversal and visitor pattern implementation
Provides common functionality for AST manipulation
Expression Class:

Represents Java expressions in the AST
Handles various expression types (literals, method calls, operators)
Provides type resolution and validation capabilities
Implements expression-specific transformations
Statement Class:

Represents Java statements in the AST
Manages different statement types (if, while, for, etc.)
Provides statement transformation and analysis capabilities
3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:

Technologies:

Pure Java implementation
Object-oriented design with inheritance hierarchy
Visitor pattern for AST traversal
Observer pattern for AST modifications
Key Dependencies:

Java Collections Framework
Java Stream API
Java Optional API
Internal metamodel framework for reflection capabilities
The system follows a clear hierarchical structure where Node serves as the foundation, with Expression and Statement extending it to provide specialized functionality for different Java language constructs. The implementation emphasizes type safety, immutability where appropriate, and extensible design through well-defined patterns.
