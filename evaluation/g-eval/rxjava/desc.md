System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the RxJava system:

**System Purpose:**
RxJava is a reactive programming library for Java that enables building asynchronous, event-based applications using observable streams. It provides a comprehensive implementation of the ReactiveX (Reactive Extensions) pattern.

**Key Components & Responsibilities:**

1. Flowable
- Handles backpressure-aware stream processing
- Implements the Publisher interface
- Provides operations for transforming and combining data streams
- Manages subscription lifecycles and error handling

2. Observable
- Manages non-backpressure stream processing
- Implements ObservableSource interface
- Offers extensive operators for stream manipulation
- Handles event emission and subscription management

3. Single
- Represents a source that emits exactly one item
- Implements SingleSource interface
- Provides specialized operators for single-value operations
- Manages success/error scenarios

**Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

1. Core Technologies:
- Java (evidenced by package structure and language features)
- ReactiveStreams specification (shown by Publisher interface usage)

2. Key Dependencies:
- io.reactivex.rxjava3 (core package namespace)
- org.reactivestreams (reactive streams specification)
- java.util.concurrent (for concurrency support)
- java.util.stream (for stream operations)

The system extensively uses method chaining, operator composition, and reactive patterns to enable functional-style stream processing with comprehensive error handling and lifecycle management capabilities.

The architecture follows a modular design where each component (Flowable, Observable, Single) provides specific functionality while sharing common reactive patterns and operators through a consistent API.
