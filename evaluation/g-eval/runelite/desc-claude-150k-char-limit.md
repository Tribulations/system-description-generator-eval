Here's a structured high-level summary of the RuneLite system:

**1. System Purpose:**
RuneLite is an open-source third-party client for Old School RuneScape (OSRS) that enhances gameplay through plugins and additional features while maintaining game integrity.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**
- Client: Core interface with the OSRS game engine
- Plugin System: Modular architecture for extending functionality
- UI Components: Custom overlays and interface enhancements
- Event Bus: Handles communication between components
- Cache Management: Manages game assets and data
- Configuration System: Handles user settings and preferences

Major plugins include:
- Bank Tags: Enhanced bank organization
- Ground Items: Item highlighting and filtering
- Agility: Training assistance
- Grand Exchange: Trading improvements
- Timers & Buffs: Status tracking

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**
- Java-based application
- Injection framework (Guice)
- Event-driven architecture
- Graphics libraries (LWJGL for GPU plugin)
- HTTP client (OkHttp)
- JSON processing (Gson)
- Lombok for code reduction
- Swing for UI components

**4. Architecture:**
- Modular plugin-based architecture
- Core client wrapper around OSRS client
- Event-driven communication system
- MVC pattern for UI components
- Injectable services for cross-cutting concerns
- Configurable components through annotations

**5. Data Flow:**
1. Game client receives data from OSRS servers
2. Client events are dispatched through the EventBus
3. Plugins subscribe to relevant events and process data
4. UI overlays render processed information
5. User interactions trigger events back to plugins
6. Configuration changes propagate through the system
7. External plugins can be loaded/unloaded dynamically

The system maintains separation between game interaction, data processing, and presentation layers while allowing extensive customization through its plugin architecture.
