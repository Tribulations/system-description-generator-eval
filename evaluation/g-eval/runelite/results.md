**Correctness**
Score: 0.8649748894770342

Reason: The system description closely aligns with the knowledge graph data, correctly identifying the RuneLite system's purpose as an OSRS third-party client with enhanced features. The description accurately highlights the Client, Widget, and Plugin 
classes and their roles, such as 'Client' extending GameEngine and OAuthApi, which matches the inputs. Mentioned technologies like Java and Guice are consistent with the import data. Only minor possible omissions in detailing every method prevent a 
perfect score.

**Relevance**
Score: 0.7426431844049839

Reason: The description effectively focuses on essential system components like Client, Widget, and Plugin classes, and their responsibilities. It mentions core technologies like Java, Guice, and AWT. However, it could better match input details, 
particularly Client class methods which are not reflected in the output summary.

**Usefulness**
Score: 0.47802348042091297

Reason: The output provides a broad overview of key components but lacks technical depth. It mentions classes and core technologies in general terms. However, it omits specific method details relevant for developers, like those present in the input's 
class method lists. It also lacks concrete examples of component interactions and doesn't fully explain dependencies or relationships between components, such as how the Client extends GameEngine and OAuthApi.
