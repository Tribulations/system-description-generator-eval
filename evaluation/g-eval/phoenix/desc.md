System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Phoenix system based on the provided knowledge graph:

**System Purpose:**
Apache Phoenix is a database layer that provides SQL access and transaction management capabilities over HBase, focusing on metadata management and query services.

**Key Components & Responsibilities:**

1. ConnectionQueryServicesImpl:
- Manages database connections and metadata caching
- Handles table operations (create, drop, alter)
- Controls schema management
- Manages system upgrades and maintenance
- Coordinates function and sequence operations

2. MetaProperties/MetaPropertiesEvaluated:
- Manages table and column metadata properties
- Handles configuration settings for tables
- Controls transactional behaviors and storage schemes
- Manages multi-tenant and performance-related properties

**Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

1. Primary Technologies:
- Java as the implementation language
- HBase as the underlying database
- SQL interface layer
- Protobuf for data serialization

2. Key Dependencies:
- Apache HBase client libraries
- Google Guava utilities
- Apache Commons components
- SLF4J for logging
- JDBC interfaces

The system implements a robust database middleware that bridges SQL functionality with HBase's NoSQL capabilities, providing transaction support, metadata management, and connection pooling while maintaining compatibility with standard database operations and protocols.
