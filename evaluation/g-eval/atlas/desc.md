System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Atlas system:

**1. System Purpose:**
Atlas is an Apache data governance and metadata management system that provides entity management, classification, and relationship tracking capabilities for data assets.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **AtlasClientV2:**
  - Main client interface for Atlas operations
  - Handles CRUD operations for entities, classifications, and glossary terms
  - Manages search operations and relationship management
  - Provides audit and lineage tracking functionality

- **GraphHelper:**
  - Core graph operations utility
  - Manages vertex and edge operations in the underlying graph database
  - Handles property management and relationship traversal
  - Provides classification and label management utilities

- **EntityGraphMapper:**
  - Maps entity operations to graph structures
  - Manages entity classifications and business attributes
  - Handles vertex creation and updates
  - Controls propagation of classifications across entities

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Technologies:
- Java-based system
- Graph database backend
- REST API architecture

Key Dependencies:
- Apache Atlas core libraries
- Jersey (REST framework)
- Graph database APIs (evidenced by AtlasGraph, AtlasVertex, AtlasEdge)
- Spring Framework (Component annotations present)
- SLF4J for logging
- Apache Commons utilities
- Jackson for JSON processing

The system implements a graph-based metadata repository with REST API access, focusing on data governance through entity management, classification, and relationship tracking. It uses a layered architecture with clear separation between client interfaces, graph operations, and entity mapping logic.
