System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Druid system based on the provided knowledge graph:

**1. System Purpose:**
Druid is a database connection pooling and monitoring system that provides JDBC connection management with filtering capabilities. It acts as a middleware layer between applications and databases, offering enhanced database connectivity features.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **FilterChainImpl:**
  - Implements the core filtering chain for database operations
  - Handles JDBC method interception and execution
  - Manages result set operations and statement execution

- **FilterAdapter:**
  - Provides base implementation for database operation filters
  - Adapts JDBC calls through a notification system
  - Implements connection pool management features

- **Filter Interface:**
  - Defines the contract for database operation filtering
  - Extends the Wrapper interface for JDBC compatibility
  - Specifies methods for handling various database operations

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Primary Technologies:
- Java
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- SQL

Key Dependencies:
- java.sql package
- java.io (for stream handling)
- java.util.concurrent (for execution handling)
- java.math.BigDecimal (for numeric operations)
- javax.management (for JMX support)

The system is built on Java's standard database connectivity architecture with additional layers for:
- Connection pooling
- Statement management
- Result set handling
- Transaction management
- Metadata operations
- Performance monitoring

The architecture follows a chain-of-responsibility pattern for filtering database operations, with comprehensive support for standard JDBC operations while adding pooling and monitoring capabilities.
