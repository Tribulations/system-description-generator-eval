**Correctness**
Score: 0.5214067903647462

Reason: The description captures the general purpose of the Paimon system as a data management system with batch and streaming capabilities but mischaracterizes 'CoreOptions' as it doesn't manage snapshot retention. The 'Factory' is not strictly tied to 
MergeTree and lacks sufficient evidence for its described functionality. The integration with Spark by 'Builder' is unclear without explicit methods supporting this. Technical terms like 'Flink' and 'Parquet' are correctly identified but their precise 
role is not clearly attributed. The overall system functionality and structure are partially accurate but contain extrapolated assumptions beyond the provided data.

**Relevance**
Score: 0.7525082438658746

Reason: The system description provides a high-level summary focusing on essential components such as CoreOptions, Factory, and Builder, which align with the input. The key technologies and components, like Java, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink, are 
accurately mentioned in the Actual Output. However, while the description is mostly aligned, some imported classes and methods like 'ProcedureBuilder' and specific methods like 'createStreamOperator' could be briefly touched upon to achieve a perfect 
relevance score.

**Usefulness**
Score: 0.4570997508772276

Reason: The summary lacks actionable insights; it provides a high-level view without in-depth technical details crucial for understanding the system architecture. The actual output uses generic descriptions, failing to utilize the specific data from the 
input, such as detailed methods or interfaces associated with each class. Relationships and dependencies among components are implied but not explicitly stated, and the text relies heavily on generalizations rather than concrete examples that reflect the
precise functionalities described in the input.
