System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Paimon system:

**1. System Purpose:**
Paimon is a data management system that provides table storage and processing capabilities with support for both batch and streaming operations in Java. It focuses on efficient file storage management, data compaction, and table operations.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **CoreOptions:**
  - Manages system-wide configuration settings
  - Handles file format configurations, compression settings, and storage parameters
  - Controls snapshot management and retention policies

- **Factory (MergeTree Component):**
  - Implements stream operation functionality
  - Handles data compaction and merging operations
  - Manages streaming state and checkpointing

- **Builder (Spark Integration):**
  - Provides integration with Apache Spark
  - Handles table schema management and configuration
  - Controls partition and bucket management

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Primary Technologies:
- Java (core implementation)
- Apache Spark (integration support)
- Apache Flink (streaming support)

Key Dependencies:
- Apache Parquet (file format support)
- Apache ORC (file format support)
- Jackson (JSON processing)
- Guava (utility functions)
- SLF4J (logging)

The system is built with a strong focus on extensibility, allowing integration with multiple big data processing frameworks while maintaining a consistent storage layer. It uses a modular architecture that separates core storage functionality from processing engine integrations.
