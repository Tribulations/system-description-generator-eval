System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the JUnit 5 system:

**1. System Purpose**
JUnit 5 is a testing framework for Java applications that provides infrastructure for writing, executing, and reporting test results. It enables developers to validate code behavior through automated tests.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities**
- Test Discovery Components: (ClassSelectorResolver, MethodSelectorResolver) - Handle test class and method discovery
- Test Execution Engine: (JupiterEngine) - Manages test execution lifecycle
- Parameter Resolution: (ParameterResolver, ArgumentsProvider) - Handles test method parameter injection
- Extension Framework: (ExtensionContext, MutableExtensionRegistry) - Provides extension points for customizing test behavior
- Reporting: (XmlReportWriter) - Generates test execution reports
- Launcher API: (LauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder) - Entry point for test execution

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies**
- Primary Language: Java
- Key Dependencies:
  - OpenTest4J: Test result reporting
  - PicoCLI: Command line interface support
  - UniVocity: CSV parsing for parameterized tests
- Platform Requirements: Java 8 or higher

**4. Architecture**
The system follows a modular architecture with distinct layers:
- Platform Layer: Core testing infrastructure
- Jupiter Layer: Main test engine implementation
- Vintage Layer: Legacy JUnit support
- Extension Layer: Pluggable test behavior customization
- Launcher Layer: Public API for test execution

**5. Data Flow**
1. Test Discovery:
   - Launcher receives discovery request
   - Selectors identify test classes/methods
   - Test descriptors are created

2. Test Execution:
   - Test engine executes discovered tests
   - Extensions intercept execution phases
   - Results are collected and reported

3. Result Reporting:
   - Test results are aggregated
   - Reports are generated in XML format
   - Results are communicated to the launcher

The system employs a plugin-based architecture that allows for extensibility while maintaining a clear separation between the test execution engine and test definition API. The design emphasizes modularity and backward compatibility through its layered structure.
