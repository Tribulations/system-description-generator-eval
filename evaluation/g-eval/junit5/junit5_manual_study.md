# Manual Study: Junit5

## System Purpose

JUnit 5 is an open-source testing framework designed for Java applications. 
The system supports defining, discovering, and executing tests.
It modernizes and extends the capabilities of previous JUnit versions to support flexible,
extensible, and robust testing across a variety of use casesâ€”including unit, integration,
and platform-specific testing. 
## Architectural Approach
JUnit 5 uses a plugin-based architecture via the ServiceLoader mechanism, enabling extensibility
at the engine, discovery, and execution levels. The system is divided into subprojects 
(`org.junit.platform.\*, org.junit.jupiter.*,` and `org.junit.vintage.engine`), 
each handling a distinct layer of the testing lifecycle.
The **JUnit Platform** module is the foundation of the framework. It establishes a 
robust interface between *JUnit* and its users, including various build tools 
while additional modules provide support for specific features such as
parameterized tests, assertions, and test engines. [junit.org](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.1/user-guide/#overview)
## Key Modules and Components
**Main Module**
- **Junit Platform Common**: Provides common utilities and constants used 
  across the platform.
- **JUnit Platform Launcher**: The entry point for launching tests from the 
  JUnit platform. It provides a programmatic API for discovering and 
  executing tests, facilitating integration with IDEs and build tools. 
- **JUnit Jupiter API**: The API for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5.

## Notable Design Patterns and Techniques
1. Builder Pattern: Used in `SuiteLauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder` to create 
   instances of `DiscoveryRequest` with a fluent interface.
2. Observer Pattern: Used in `TestExecutionListener` to notify listeners about 
   test execution events.
3. Command Pattern: Used in the test execution process to encapsulate 
   all the information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a 
   later time. 
4. Several other design patterns are used in the system, including 
   Strategy, Decorator, Factory method, and Singleton patterns.

## Relationships and Dependencies
[Description of key relationships between components]
**Junit Platform** is the central module that coordinates the interaction
between various components. It depends on the *JUnit Platform Commons*
and *JUnit Platform Launcher* modules for core functionality.

## Important Implementation Details
[Notable implementation aspects relevant to high-level understanding (If applicable)]
**Dynamic Test Discovery & Execution**
JUnit 5 supports dynamic test discovery using the TestEngine SPI provided by 
the junit-platform-engine module. The Launcher API enables test execution 
across multiple engines (e.g., Jupiter, Vintage), allowing developers to run 
tests without hard-wiring them at compile time.
