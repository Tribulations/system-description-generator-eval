System Description: Here's a structured summary of the JUnit 5 system based on the provided knowledge graph:

**1. System Purpose:**
JUnit 5 is a testing framework for Java applications, specifically focusing on test execution and management. This particular segment handles test infrastructure support, including temporary file management and test suite configuration.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

* CloseablePath:
  - Manages temporary file resources during test execution
  - Implements automatic resource cleanup through AutoCloseable interface
  - Handles file system operations and path management

* SuiteLauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder:
  - Builds and configures test suite execution requests
  - Manages test selectors and filters
  - Handles configuration parameters for test suite execution

* FieldContext:
  - Provides context for field-level test annotations
  - Manages parameter resolution and field access during test execution
  - Extends AnnotatedElementContext for annotation processing

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Primary Technologies:
- Java SE (evidenced by java.* imports)
- JUnit Platform Commons
- JUnit Jupiter API

Key Dependencies:
- java.nio.file (for file operations)
- java.util.concurrent (for concurrent operations)
- java.lang.reflect (for reflection capabilities)
- org.junit.platform.* (core JUnit platform)
- org.junit.jupiter.* (Jupiter test engine)
- org.apiguardian.api (for API governance)

The system is built on Java's standard libraries with strong integration into the JUnit testing ecosystem, focusing on extensibility and robust test execution management.
