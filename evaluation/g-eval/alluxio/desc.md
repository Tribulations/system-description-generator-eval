System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Alluxio system:

**System Purpose:**
Alluxio is a distributed file system that serves as a data orchestration layer, managing data access and storage across different storage systems. It provides unified data access and caching capabilities in distributed computing environments.

**Key Components & Responsibilities:**
1. FileSystemMaster:
- Manages the file system metadata and namespace
- Handles file operations (create, delete, rename)
- Controls mount points and synchronization
- Manages access control and permissions

2. Metrics Component:
- Tracks system performance metrics
- Handles gauge registration and monitoring
- Manages UFS (Under File System) operation statistics

3. Factory Components:
- Provides creation mechanisms for system objects
- Manages resource instantiation
- Handles mount point configurations

**Core Technologies & Dependencies:**
1. Primary Technologies:
- Java as the main programming language
- gRPC for remote procedure calls
- Protocol Buffers for data serialization

2. Key Dependencies:
- Google Guava for utility functions
- Apache Commons for common operations
- Codahale Metrics for metrics collection
- JNR for native runtime access
- Netty for network communication

3. Storage Integration:
- Support for multiple under-storage systems
- Integration with various file systems (HDFS, S3, etc.)
- Native caching mechanisms

The system implements a master-worker architecture with strong emphasis on distributed operation management and data access control, utilizing Java's concurrent programming features for thread safety and performance.
