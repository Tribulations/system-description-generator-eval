System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the system:

**System Purpose:**
Checkstyle is a static code analysis tool for checking Java source code compliance with coding standards and rules. It performs automated code review to enforce coding conventions and identify potential issues.

**Key Components & Responsibilities:**

1. JavaAstVisitor:
- Core component that traverses Java Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Implements comprehensive visit methods for all Java language constructs
- Handles parsing and analysis of Java code structures including classes, methods, expressions, and statements

2. AbstractCheck:
- Base framework for implementing individual code checks
- Manages the lifecycle of code analysis (init, visitToken, leaveToken, destroy)
- Provides utilities for violation reporting and token processing

3. Example1:
- Sample implementation class demonstrating various Java language features
- Used for testing and validation of the checking system

**Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

1. Primary Technologies:
- Java (core language)
- ANTLR (parser framework, evidenced by BaseVisitor implementation)

2. Key Dependencies:
- Java Language Parser components
- Common utilities (com.puppycrawl.tools)
- Standard Java libraries (java.util, java.io)
- Logging frameworks
- Testing frameworks (JUnit, referenced in imports)

The system follows a visitor-based architectural pattern for traversing and analyzing Java source code, with a clear separation between the parsing infrastructure (JavaAstVisitor), check framework (AbstractCheck), and concrete implementations.
