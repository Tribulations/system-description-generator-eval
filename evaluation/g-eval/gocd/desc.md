System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the GoCD system based on the provided code:

**1. System Purpose:**
GoCD is a continuous delivery system that manages software pipelines, handling pipeline execution, stage management, and build history tracking.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

* PipelineInstanceModel:
  - Manages pipeline execution state and metadata
  - Handles pipeline locking/unlocking mechanisms
  - Tracks pipeline stages and their execution status
  - Manages material revisions and build causes

* PipelineSqlMapDao:
  - Provides database persistence for pipeline data
  - Handles pipeline history and stage status tracking
  - Manages pipeline pause/unpause operations
  - Implements caching mechanisms for performance

* Stage:
  - Represents a pipeline stage execution
  - Manages stage state transitions
  - Tracks job instances within stages
  - Handles stage approval and scheduling logic

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

* Primary Technologies:
  - Java (core language)
  - iBatis/MyBatis (database mapping)
  - Spring Framework (dependency injection, transaction management)
  - EhCache (caching infrastructure)

* Key Dependencies:
  - Spring components (SqlMapClientDaoSupport, transaction management)
  - Hibernate (persistence)
  - SLF4J (logging)
  - Commons Lang (utility functions)
  - JUnit (testing infrastructure)

The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation between domain models, data access, and pipeline execution logic, implementing a robust continuous delivery pipeline management solution.
