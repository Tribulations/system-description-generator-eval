System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the system:

**1. System Purpose:**
The "rewrite" system is a source code transformation and analysis tool that processes and modifies code across multiple programming languages. It provides a framework for executing recipes (transformation rules) on source code.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **Builder:** 
  - Handles configuration and setup of the system
  - Manages parsers for different languages (Java, Kotlin, Groovy, TOML, XML)
  - Controls HTTP operations and authentication
  - Configures classpath and dependency resolution

- **Recipe:**
  - Defines code transformation rules
  - Manages validation and execution of transformations
  - Handles recipe metadata and documentation
  - Controls transformation cycles and visitor patterns

- **Padding:**
  - Manages source code formatting and whitespace
  - Handles AST node modifications and transformations
  - Controls code structure preservation during transformations

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Primary Technologies:
- Java (primary implementation language)
- Jackson (JSON processing)
- Lombok (code generation)
- ASM (bytecode manipulation)
- Antlr (parsing)

Key Dependencies:
- Micrometer (metrics)
- SLF4J (logging)
- JUnit (testing)
- Various language-specific parsers:
  - JavaParser
  - KotlinParser
  - GroovyParser
  - XMLParser
  - TOMLParser
  - HCLParser

The system is designed as a modular framework that supports multiple programming languages and provides a robust infrastructure for code analysis and transformation through a recipe-based approach. It emphasizes type safety, extensibility, and maintainable code transformations.
