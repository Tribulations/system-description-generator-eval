**Correctness**
Score: 0.5965221332752313

Reason: The description closely matches the knowledge graph but has discrepancies in stated responsibilities of components, like the 'Builder Class' handling transit preferences is not represented similarly in the input data. Also, some aspects such as 
'Transit Priority Calculator' mentioned in methods but omitted in description. It provides a basic summary but lacks precise alignment with the specific roles and function descriptions found in the input data.

**Relevance**
Score: 0.8076366776995805

Reason: The system description aligns well with the core functionality reflected in the input. It focuses on essential components such as the Builder, DefaultTransitService, and GraphQLQueryTypePlanArgs, corresponding to the classes in the input. The 
core technologies mentioned like Java and GraphQL are relevant to the methods and imports of these classes. However, there could be slightly reduced emphasis on peripheral technologies to improve focus.

**Usefulness**
Score: 0.483969789332282

Reason: The description provides a high-level overview of the OpenTripPlanner components but lacks enough technical specifics about system architecture, such as classes and methods detailed in the input, and does not detail component interrelations or 
give concrete examples, relying on general explanations instead.
