- Provides persistent storage for messages
- Manages journal files and indexes
- Handles transaction logging
- Implements message recovery mechanisms
- Controls data file management and cleanup

**Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

1. Core Platform:
- Java-based implementation
- JMS (Jakarta Message Service) specification compliance

2. Storage:
- KahaDB for message persistence
- Journal-based storage system
- File-based indexing

3. Key Dependencies:
- SLF4J for logging
- Protocol support (OpenWire, STOMP, MQTT)
- Jakarta/Java EE APIs
- Concurrent utilities from java.util.concurrent
