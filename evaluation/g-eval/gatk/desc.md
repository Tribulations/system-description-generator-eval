System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit) system:

**1. System Purpose:**
GATK is a genomic analysis toolkit that processes and analyzes genomic data, particularly focused on variant discovery in genomic sequences and processing DNA sequence data.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**
- `GATKTool`: Base component that provides core genomic analysis functionality including:
  - Reference genome handling
  - Interval processing
  - Read filtering and transformation
  - Variant annotation management
  
- `GATKSparkTool`: Extends the base functionality to support distributed processing using Apache Spark, handling:
  - Distributed read processing
  - Parallel genomic data analysis
  - Spark-specific optimizations for genomic computations

- `Serializer`: Handles data serialization and deserialization for genomic data structures, supporting:
  - Reading/writing genomic data
  - Format conversion
  - Data persistence

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**
- Primary Framework: Java
- Key Dependencies:
  - Apache Spark (for distributed processing)
  - HTSJDK (for handling genomic file formats)
  - Apache Commons (utilities)
  - Log4j (logging)
  - Kryo (serialization)

Core External Libraries:
- SAM/BAM file processing libraries
- VCF (Variant Call Format) processing utilities
- Reference genome handling utilities
- Compression libraries (GZip, BlockCompressed)

The system is designed as a modular toolkit that combines high-performance genomic analysis capabilities with distributed processing support, primarily focused on handling large-scale genomic data analysis tasks
