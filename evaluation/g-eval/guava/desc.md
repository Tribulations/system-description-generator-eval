System Description: Here's a structured summary of the Guava system based on the provided knowledge graph:

1. **System Purpose:**
Guava is a core Java collections framework extension that provides enhanced collection implementations and utilities for Java applications. It focuses on providing optimized and extended collection operations beyond the standard Java Collections Framework.

2. **Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **EntrySet Class:**
  - Handles collection entry management with advanced operations
  - Provides comprehensive set operations (add, remove, contains)
  - Implements iterator patterns and collection modifications

- **KeySet Class:**
  - Manages key-based operations for collections
  - Handles key-specific set operations
  - Provides key-based lookups and modifications

- **Values Class:**
  - Manages collection values
  - Implements collection value operations
  - Extends AbstractCollection for value handling

3. **Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Primary Technologies:
- Java SE (core platform)
- Java Collections Framework

Key Dependencies:
- com.google.common.collect (primary package)
- java.util.* (standard collections)
- java.util.concurrent.* (concurrency utilities)
- java.util.function.* (functional interfaces)
- com.google.common.base (base utilities)
- com.google.errorprone.annotations (error checking)
- org.jspecify.annotations (nullability specifications)

The system is built as a robust extension to Java's collection framework, with strong emphasis on type safety, concurrent operations, and enhanced functionality while maintaining compatibility with standard Java collections.
