System Description: Here's a structured summary of the Debezium system based on the provided code:

**1. System Purpose:**
Debezium is a distributed platform for change data capture (CDC). It monitors databases and streams changes in row-level data to downstream consumers.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

* `Builder` (io.debezium.transforms.scripting.wasm):
  - Handles WebAssembly (WASM) module configuration and integration
  - Manages transaction, source, and record transformations
  - Provides data mapping and string manipulation capabilities

* `JdbcConnection` (io.debezium.jdbc):
  - Manages database connectivity and operations
  - Handles table metadata reading and SQL query execution
  - Provides transaction management and schema operations

* `GeneralDatabaseDialect`:
  - Implements database-specific SQL syntax and behaviors
  - Handles data type mappings and SQL statement generation
  - Manages database-specific identifier conventions

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Primary Technologies:
- Java (core language)
- JDBC (database connectivity)
- WebAssembly (for extensibility)
- Kafka Connect (integration framework)

Key Dependencies:
- Apache Kafka
- SLF4J (logging)
- Hibernate
- Jackson (JSON processing)
- Antlr (parsing)
- PostgreSQL JDBC driver

The system is built as a modular platform with clear separation between database connectivity, transformation logic, and streaming capabilities. It leverages standard Java enterprise technologies while providing modern features like WebAssembly integration for extensibility.
