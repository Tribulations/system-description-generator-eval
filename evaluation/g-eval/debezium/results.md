**Correctness**
Score: 0.6704980230412899

Reason: The description correctly identifies Debezium's purpose and mentions relevant classes like Builder and JdbcConnection. However, it assumes Builder's capabilities, such as transaction and record transformation, without explicit input confirmation.
The technologies listed are valid but lacking some core details from the actual methods.

**Relevance**
Score: 0.7110550282217082

Reason: The description focuses on key system components like Debezium's purpose, major classes such as Builder and JdbcConnection, and core technologies. However, it introduces some unnecessary details, such as specific technical methods and imports, 
detracting from the high-level overview required. The abstraction level varies slightly, but overall, it highlights important facts relevant for a new developer.

**Usefulness**
Score: 0.5041542878564109

Reason: The output describes the system's purpose and components but lacks technical depth. It does not address method-level details or provide sufficient examples from the input. Relationships and dependencies are briefly mentioned, but understanding 
them fully requires additional information. Technical terms are accurately used highlighting Builder, JdbcConnection, and GeneralDatabaseDialect, but specific method calls are absent in the component descriptions.
