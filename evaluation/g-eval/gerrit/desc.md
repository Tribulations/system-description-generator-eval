System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Gerrit system:

**1. System Purpose:**
Gerrit is a web-based code review and project management system for Git repositories. It provides a collaborative platform for developers to review code changes, manage projects, and control access to repositories.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **Factory Classes:**
  - Handle object creation and initialization for various system components
  - Manage change reviews, comments, and user permissions
  - Create and configure repositories and project settings

- **Builder Classes:**
  - Construct complex objects like permissions, rules, and configurations
  - Handle comment creation and management
  - Build review and submission workflows

- **Metrics Component:**
  - Monitors system performance and usage
  - Tracks connections, threads, and request statistics
  - Manages resource utilization metrics

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Primary Technologies:
- Java (core implementation language)
- Git (version control integration)
- JGit (Git implementation in Java)
- Jetty (web server)
- Prolog (for custom rules)

Key Dependencies:
- Google Guice (dependency injection)
- BouncyCastle (cryptography)
- Apache SSHD (SSH support)
- Protocol Buffers (data serialization)
- Apache Commons
- Google Common Libraries
- Eclipse JGit
- Various testing frameworks (JUnit, etc.)

The system is built as a modular application with clear separation between web interfaces, repository management, authentication, and review processes. It heavily utilizes dependency injection and builder patterns to maintain flexibility and extensibility in its implementation.
