**Correctness**
Score: 0.5756896434170214

Reason: The actual output accurately describes Gobblin's purpose and core technologies, but lacks detail alignment with class methods and interfaces from the input, especially about the Factory class's complexity and NonScheduledJobRunner's 
functionalities beyond basic execution tasks.

**Relevance**
Score: 0.604887596518491

Reason: The description accurately reflects the purpose of Gobblin and its key components but includes detailed technology dependencies that overlap with core technologies, which do not directly align with specific input class or method details.

**Usefulness**
Score: 0.44942841963689767

Reason: The output provides a general high-level summary of Gobblin but lacks technical depth. It mentions component responsibilities, but doesn't detail implemented interfaces or method specifics. Technologies are listed but not tied to functionality. 
More integration details, particularly for the Builder and Factory components related to the Java classes in the input, are needed for clarity.
