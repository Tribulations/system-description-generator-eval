System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Hazelcast system:

**System Purpose:**
Hazelcast is a distributed in-memory data management system that provides distributed data structures and computing capabilities. It primarily functions as a distributed caching and computing platform.

**Key Components & Responsibilities:**

1. Message Task Factory System:
- DefaultMessageTaskFactoryProvider: Manages protocol message handling and task creation
- Handles various distributed operations like map, cache, queue, and transaction management

2. Client Map Implementation:
- ClientMapProxy: Implements distributed map operations with features like:
  * Data access operations (get, put, remove)
  * Locking mechanisms
  * Event listening
  * Query capabilities
  * Entry processing
  * Asynchronous operations

3. Builder Component:
- Provides construction and configuration capabilities for system components
- Handles serialization, event processing, and connection management

**Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

1. Core Platform:
- Java-based implementation
- Uses client-server architecture
- Native serialization system

2. Integration Components:
- AWS Kinesis integration
- Kafka connectivity
- SQL support
- JMS support

3. Key Dependencies:
- Debezium for CDC (Change Data Capture)
- AWS SDK
- Hazelcast core libraries
- Logging frameworks
- Concurrent utilities from Java

The system is built as a distributed platform with strong emphasis on data consistency, high availability, and scalable operations across a cluster of nodes. It provides both synchronous and asynchronous operation capabilities with comprehensive event handling and monitoring features.
