System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the graylog2-server system:

**1. System Purpose:**
Graylog2 is a log management and analysis platform that collects, indexes, and analyzes log data from various sources in real-time. It provides centralized logging, searching, and alerting capabilities for IT infrastructure and applications.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **Event Processing System**
  - Handles event definitions, notifications, and processing
  - Manages event aggregation and alerting workflows
  - Coordinates job scheduling and execution

- **Input/Transport Layer**
  - Supports multiple input types (GELF, Syslog, IPFIX, NetFlow, etc.)
  - Handles message receiving and initial processing
  - Implements various transport protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, AMQP)

- **Search & Analytics**
  - Provides search functionality across indexed logs
  - Manages search types and queries
  - Handles data aggregation and visualization

- **Security & Authentication**
  - Implements user authentication and authorization
  - Manages permissions and access control
  - Handles encryption and security configurations

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Primary Technologies:
- Java as the main programming language
- Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for data indexing and search
- MongoDB for configuration and metadata storage
- Netty for network communication
- Kafka for message queuing (optional)

Key Dependencies:
- Jackson for JSON processing
- Guice for dependency injection
- Metrics for system monitoring
- OkHttp for HTTP client operations
- Protobuf for data serialization
- gRPC for remote procedure calls
- Various AWS SDK components for cloud integration

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation between components handling input processing, event management, search operations, and system administration. It's designed to be scalable and extensible through a plugin system.
