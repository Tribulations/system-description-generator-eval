System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Apache Iceberg system:

**1. System Purpose:**
Apache Iceberg is a table format system that provides versioned data management and optimized querying for large analytic datasets. It handles table metadata tracking, schema evolution, and efficient data file organization.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **Builder Component:**
  - Manages table and view construction operations
  - Handles configuration settings for table operations
  - Controls transaction management and schema modifications
  - Manages partition specifications and sort orders

- **ReadBuilder Component:**
  - Handles data reading operations and file scanning
  - Manages schema projection and filtering
  - Controls columnar data access and statistics
  - Implements partition pruning and predicate pushdown

- **WriteBuilder Component:**
  - Manages data writing operations
  - Handles file format-specific write configurations
  - Controls compression and encoding settings
  - Manages metadata writing and statistics collection

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Primary Technologies:
- Java (core implementation language)
- Parquet (columnar storage format)
- Avro (data serialization)
- ORC (columnar storage format)

Key Integration Points:
- Apache Spark (data processing)
- Apache Flink (stream processing)
- Hadoop (distributed storage)

Major Dependencies:
- Google Guava (utility libraries)
- SLF4J (logging)
- Jackson (JSON processing)
- Apache Commons (utility functions)
- Various compression codecs (Snappy, ZSTD, etc.)

The system is designed to work with big data ecosystems and provides a robust foundation for managing large-scale analytical datasets with features like schema evolution, partition evolution, and time travel capabilities.
