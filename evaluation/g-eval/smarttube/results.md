**Correctness**
Score: 0.7403858722740198

Reason: The system description accurately outlines the primary function as video playback and identifies correct components like PlaybackFragment, ViewHolder, and ComponentListener with correct roles. However, it overstates PlaybackFragment's abilities 
by mentioning 'multiple sources' without specific input support as seen in the JSON graph. Technologies listed are accurate, but some elements like 'custom playback controls' lack precise references in the input data.

**Relevance**
Score: 0.7978079545173885

Reason: The description successfully captures the key components such as 'PlaybackFragment', 'ViewHolder', and 'ComponentListener' with their core responsibilities. It highlights essential system components and major technologies like 'Android 
Framework', 'ExoPlayer', and 'Surface/TextureView', aligning well with the input data. However, the input provides a more detailed method breakdown for 'PlaybackFragment' that isn't fully reflected in the output, suggesting a slight abstraction mismatch.

**Usefulness**
Score: 0.4676074348268272

Reason: The output provides a basic system description but lacks specific technical details like the extended classes and implemented interfaces from Input. While some core technologies are mentioned, detailed component interactions and dependencies are 
not clearly explained. The description resorts to abstract explanations without concrete examples.
