System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Netty buffer system:

**1. System Purpose:**
The system implements a byte buffer management framework for efficient network I/O operations in Netty, providing a unified API for handling binary data with both direct and heap-based memory buffers.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- `ByteBuf`: Core interface defining the fundamental buffer operations including:
  - Reading/writing primitive data types
  - Memory management operations
  - Buffer capacity control
  - Reference counting
  - Byte order handling

- `WrappedByteBuf`: Base implementation class providing buffer delegation functionality
  - Implements buffer operations by forwarding to an underlying buffer
  - Handles buffer wrapping and unwrapping
  - Manages memory addressing and buffer properties

- `WrappedCompositeByteBuf`: Specialized implementation for composite buffers
  - Manages multiple buffers as a single logical buffer
  - Handles component-based operations
  - Provides efficient memory utilization

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Technologies:
- Java NIO (evidenced by ByteBuffer usage)
- Zero-copy buffer implementations
- Reference counting memory management

Key Dependencies:
- Java standard libraries:
  - java.nio.ByteBuffer
  - java.nio.channels
  - java.io streams
  - java.nio.charset
- Netty internal utilities:
  - io.netty.util.ByteProcessor
  - io.netty.util.ReferenceCounted

The system is built on Java's native I/O capabilities while providing enhanced functionality and performance optimizations specific to Netty's networking requirements.
