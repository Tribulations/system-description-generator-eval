**Correctness**
Score: 0.8530154598410207

Reason: The description correctly identifies the system purpose, mentions key components (ServerBuilder, GrpcBuilder, Flags) with roles that align with methods listed in input, and accurately identifies core technologies and dependencies. However, the 
GrpcBuilder is described without matching input data for 'GrpcBuilder,' and there is minor extrapolation in 'gRPC service configuration' aspect.

**Relevance**
Score: 0.8237148091534288

Reason: The system description maintains focus on essential components like ServerBuilder and GrpcBuilder, and covers core aspects such as technologies and key dependencies. However, it includes a lot of technology list that though factual, might not 
critically enhance understanding of core system architecture per se.

**Usefulness**
Score: 0.5319115633551673

Reason: The output lacks detailed technical information necessary for understanding system architecture. There are no concrete examples of how components like ServerBuilder and GrpcBuilder function together or how dependencies interact with Armeria. The 
terminology is generally correct, but connections between components and technical details are not deeply explored, resulting in a lack of actionable insights.
