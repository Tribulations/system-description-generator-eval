System Description: Here's a structured summary of the Armeria system:

**1. System Purpose:**
Armeria is a server-side networking/HTTP framework designed to build and manage HTTP/2 and gRPC services in Java. It provides functionality for creating, configuring, and managing network servers with advanced protocol support.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **ServerBuilder:**
  - Core component for configuring and constructing server instances
  - Manages server settings like ports, protocols, timeouts, and TLS
  - Handles service registration and routing configuration
  - Controls server resources and connection parameters

- **GrpcBuilder:**
  - Specialized component for gRPC service configuration
  - Manages gRPC-specific settings and service bindings

- **Flags:**
  - System-wide configuration management
  - Defines default values and operational parameters
  - Controls behavior for networking, security, and performance settings

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Technologies:
- Java (primary implementation language)
- HTTP/2 protocol support
- gRPC framework integration
- TLS/SSL security capabilities

Key Dependencies:
- Netty (network application framework)
- Micrometer (metrics and monitoring)
- Google Guava (utility libraries)
- SLF4J (logging facade)
- gRPC libraries
- Various Java concurrent utilities

The system is built with a strong focus on type safety, configurability, and performance, providing a robust foundation for building modern network services. It emphasizes secure defaults and extensive customization options for production deployments.
