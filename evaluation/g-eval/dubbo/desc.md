System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Dubbo system based on the provided knowledge graph:

**1. System Purpose:**
Dubbo is a distributed service framework that provides service registration, discovery, and remote procedure call (RPC) capabilities. It enables applications to expose and consume services in a distributed environment.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **Builder Class:**
  - Handles service metadata construction and management
  - Manages service parameters, configurations, and attributes
  - Provides methods for building service definitions and requests

- **URL Class:**
  - Core component for service addressing and parameter management
  - Handles service endpoint information (protocol, host, port)
  - Manages service attributes and configuration parameters

- **RegistryProtocol Class:**
  - Implements service registration and discovery
  - Manages service export and reference operations
  - Handles service invocation and protocol binding

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Technologies:
- Java-based implementation
- Protocol-based communication
- Registry-based service discovery

Key Dependencies:
- Java Collections Framework
- Concurrent utilities (ConcurrentHashMap, atomic classes)
- Logging frameworks
- Extension loading mechanism
- Network/remoting capabilities

Core Features:
- Service registration and discovery
- Parameter management and validation
- Protocol handling and conversion
- Configuration management
- Metadata management
- Service invocation chain handling
- Load balancing support
- High availability features through clustering

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between service definition, addressing, and protocol handling components, enabling flexible distributed service management.
