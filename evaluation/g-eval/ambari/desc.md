System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the Ambari system:

**1. System Purpose:**
Ambari is an Apache project that provides a management and monitoring platform for Apache Hadoop clusters. It enables system administrators to deploy, manage, and monitor Hadoop services through a web interface.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **AmbariManagementControllerImpl:**
  - Core controller handling cluster management operations
  - Manages services, hosts, configurations, and security
  - Coordinates system-wide operations like upgrades and installations

- **ClusterImpl:**
  - Implements cluster management functionality
  - Handles configuration management
  - Manages service components and host relationships
  - Controls cluster state and security settings

- **ControllerModule:**
  - Provides dependency injection configuration
  - Sets up system persistence and security
  - Configures system services and components

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Primary Technologies:
- Java (Core platform)
- JPA/Persistence framework
- Spring Framework
- Guice (Dependency Injection)
- Jersey (REST services)
- Jetty (Web server)

Key Dependencies:
- Database systems (supports MySQL and others)
- Security frameworks (Kerberos integration)
- Configuration management systems
- Metrics collection and monitoring tools
- Apache Hadoop ecosystem components

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation between management, implementation, and configuration layers. It heavily utilizes dependency injection and implements various design patterns to maintain flexibility and extensibility in managing Hadoop clusters.
