System Description: Here's a structured high-level summary of the javaparser system:

**1. System Purpose:**
JavaParser is a Java source code parsing and analysis tool that provides programmatic access to Java source code structure. It enables parsing Java code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for analysis, manipulation, and transformation.

**2. Key Components & Responsibilities:**

- **Expression Class:**
  - Handles all Java expression types (literals, method calls, operators, etc.)
  - Provides comprehensive type checking and expression validation
  - Implements visitor pattern for traversing expressions

- **GeneratedJavaParser Class:**
  - Core parsing engine that converts Java source into AST
  - Implements detailed parsing rules for all Java language constructs
  - Manages token processing and syntax validation

- **Node Class:**
  - Base class for all AST nodes
  - Provides common functionality for tree traversal
  - Handles parent-child relationships and node visitors
  - Manages source code position tracking and comments

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies:**

Technologies:
- Pure Java implementation
- Visitor pattern for AST traversal
- Observer pattern for AST modifications

Key Dependencies:
- Java Collections Framework
- Java Stream API
- Internal metamodel framework for reflection
- Symbol resolution system for type analysis

The system is designed as a standalone Java library with minimal external dependencies, focusing on robust parsing and AST manipulation capabilities while maintaining a clean object-oriented structure.
