## Part 1: Manual Study of Selected Repositories

### Purpose
To gain an understanding of the software system's purpose, architecture, functionality, and design to enable accurate evaluation of SDG-generated descriptions.

### Study Process

#### 1. Reviewing Documentation
- Examine README files, wiki pages, and official websites
- Review JavaDocs and API documentation
- Study available UML diagrams (package diagrams, architecture diagrams)
- Document key insights about:
  - System purpose and main functionalities
  - Design philosophy and architectural approach
  - Main components and their relationships

#### 2. Architecture Analysis
- Identify dependencies using IntelliJ IDEA's Analyze Dependencies feature (or any equivalent tool of your choice).
- Identify major architectural components
- Document key design patterns implemented in the system
- Analyze package structure and organization
- Map inheritance hierarchies for key classes
- Identify dependency relationships between key classes

#### 3. Module Analysis
- Identify how the system is divided into functional components using IntelliJ IDEA's Analyze Dependencies feature (or any equivalent tool of your choice)
- Categorize modules based on their responsibilities

#### 4. Code Inspection
- Select key or frequently used classes for detailed study
- Examine method signatures and interface implementations
- Study class relationships and dependencies at code level
- Verify or refine the high-level understanding gained in previous steps

#### 5. Documentation of Study Findings
Create a structured document (see templates below) with the following sections:
- System Purpose
- Architectural Approach
- Key Modules and Components
- Notable Design Patterns and Techniques
- Relationships and Dependencies
- Important Implementation Details

## Part 2: Manual Evaluation of Generated Descriptions

### Purpose
To systematically evaluate the quality of SDG-generated descriptions based on correctness, relevance, and usefulness.

### Evaluation Process

#### 1. Initial Review
- Carefully read the generated description without forming any opinions
- Identify the main architectural elements and claims made in the description
- Document initial thoughts on how the description is structured and which elements are emphasized

#### 2. Systematic Evaluation
For each evaluation metric (correctness, relevance, usefulness), follow these steps:

##### 2.1 Evaluation of Correctness
- Compare the architectural elements, components, and relationships in the generated description against the manual study findings
- Check for factual errors or misrepresentations
- Identify any ommited important architectural elements
- Evaluate the accuracy of described behaviors and interactions
- Assign a score from 1 to 5 based on the grading schema: [Correctness](#grading-schema-reference)

##### 2.2 Evaluation of Relevance
- Assess whether the description focuses on the important architectural aspects of the system
- Identify irrelevant information or unnecessary details
- Determine if the description conveys a clear overall picture of the system's architecture
- Check that no critical architectural elements are underrepresented or missing while less important elements receive too much attention
- Assign a score from 1 to 5 based on the grading schema: [Relevance](#grading-schema-reference)

##### 2.3 Evaluation of Usefulness
- Assess whether the description would help a developer understand the system's architecture
- Evaluate whether it provides actionable insights for working with the system
- Assess if key architectural decisions and their rationales are explained
- Check if the description would aid in system comprehension
- Assign a score from 1 to 5 based on the grading schema: [Usefulness](#grading-schema-reference)

#### 3. Evaluation Documentation
For each metric, document:
- The assigned score (1-5)
- The reason for the score with references to specific elements in the description
- Examples of strengths or weaknesses that influenced the score

### Grading Schema Reference

| Score | Correctness | Usefulness | Relevance |
|-------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Major inaccuracies, misleading or factually incorrect information about system components, behavior, or interactions. | Does not provide any actionable or insightful information for understanding the system. | Entirely irrelevant to the system, it does not relate to the system at all. |
| 2 | Frequent inaccuracies or misunderstandings of key architectural elements, with some information being correct but overall misleading. | Provides little useful information. Most important, helpful information, are missing or unclear. Low support for comprehension. | Mostly irrelevant, only minor parts relate to the high-level view of the system, but the majority does not. |
| 3 | Mostly correct, with some minor errors or omissions, captures the main architectural elements but lacks important details. | Provides a generally helpful overview for understanding the system. Includes some useful insights but could be clearer or more focused in certain parts. | Partially relevant, describes some correct architectural elements but includes unnecessary or unrelated information. |
| 4 | Generally correct and accurate, minor details may be missing or slightly imprecise, but the main structure and behavior are well described. | Provides clear and mostly useful insights into the system's architecture. Supports understanding with only minor gaps. | Mostly relevant. Nearly all content relates to the system, with only slight deviations. |
| 5 | Fully correct. Aligns with the system's behavior, structure, and architecture. Contains no factual errors. | Very useful. Offers actionable insights that significantly support understanding of the system's architecture. | Fully relevant. All information directly relates to the described system and its architecture. |
